Objective
    First player to reach a point goal wins. Both players start with a flag in their main spawn. Slimes must go to the enemy spawn, collect the flag by touching it, 
    and bring back the flag to their base. Every time this is completed you gain 1 point. This must be done with your flag still at your spawn to count. When a 
    slime collects a flag they are converted into a “flagbarer slime”. When flagbarer is defeated the flag is dropped in the exact same spot. If you touch your flag
    outside of your spawn it will be immediately returned to its original place at your spawn.
